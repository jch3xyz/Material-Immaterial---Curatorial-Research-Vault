## I. PREMISE

Art is not a commodity.
Culture is not a mirror.
Technology is not the problem.

Technology reflects the system that produces it.
If built to extract, it will extract.
If built to connect, it can transform.

Paradigms seed systems.

You can’t think your way into 
transcending a paradigm.

Experience is the crucible 
of transformation.

To shift a paradigm, 
You must have an experience.

One that disrupts 
the ordinary, 
rewires your perceptions, 

and 
opens a portal 
beyond the system.

Cultural transformation 
begins in experience.

  
### Leverage points to intervene in any system:

Transcending Paradigms
    Paradigms
        Goals
            Self-Organization
                Rules
                    Information Flows
                        Reinforcing Loops
                            Balancing Loops
                                Delays
                                    Structures
                                        Buffers
                                            Numbers

  

## II. PRINCIPLES

**Follow The feeling**
If it doesn’t move you, it doesn’t matter.

**Design for disruption**
Break the routine. Misuse the Material.
Point out the strange in the ordinary. 

**Reveal the system**
Expose the hidden logic. Design not just what’s seen—but how it’s seen.

**Collapse the boundaries**
Between art and design, engineering and craft, audience and participant, etc.

**Invite participation**
Design with others, and for others. Meaning emerges through interaction. 

  
## III. BOUNDARIES

We don’t compromise artistic sovereignty to serve optics, metrics, or shareholder value.

We don’t wield the tools of transformation to persuade, distract, or control.

## IV. AESTHETICS

**Interactivity **
Design for participation.

**Embodiment**
Center the body. Engage the senses.

**Clarity** 
Signal, not noise.

**Resonance**
True to you, true to them.

## V. TRANSMISSION

We are not building a 
brand

We are building the world we want to live in

Each experience 
is a portal

Each project 
is a prototype

Each gathering 
is a spark

Each signal
is a seed

Each design
is a shift

We use design to shift culture—

Not with spectacle
but with embodiment

Not with reach
but with resonance

Not for attention
but for awakening

In a world full of noise
we carry the signal

We disrupt the ordinary
to address the strangeness

We reveal the hidden logic
beneath the interface

We collapse the boundaries
between art and design,
mechanism and medium,
audience and participant

We do not decorate the present
We prototype the future

We are architects of
experience

shifting the paradigm

And we are 
just getting started

NMN

You’re not an audience.

You are a participant.
