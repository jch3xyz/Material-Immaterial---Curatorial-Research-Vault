    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/Since the spectacle's job is to use various specialized mediations in order to show us a world that can no longer be directly grasped, it naturally elevates the sense of sight to the special preeminence once occupied by touch..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/All individual reality has become social, in the sense that it is shaped by social forces and is directly dependent on them. Individual reality is allowed to appear only insofar as it is not actually real..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The present stage is bringing about a general shift from having to appearing - all having must now derive its immediate prestige and its ultimate purpose from appearances..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The first stage of the economy's domination of social life brought about an evident degradation of being into having - human fulfilment was no longer equated with what one was, but with what one possessed..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The spectacle is able to subject human beings to itself because the economy has already totally subjugated them. It is at once a faithful reflection of the production of things and a distorting objectification of the producers..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The spectacle is a visible negation of life - a negation that has taken on a visible form..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/Objective reality is present on both sides. Reality emerges within the spectacle, and the spectacle becomes real. This reciprocal alienation is the essence and support of the existing society..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The Spectacle that falsifies reality is nevertheless a real product of that reality, while lived reality is materially invaded by the contemplation of the spectacle and ends up absorbing it and aligning itself with it..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The social practice confronted by an autonomous spectacle is at the same time the real totality which contains that spectacle. But the split within this totality mutilates it to the point that the spectacle seems to be its goal..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The Spectacle is also the constant presence of this justification since it monopolizes the majority of the time spent outside the modern production process..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The Spectacle is the omnipresent affirmation of the choices that have already been made in the sphere of production and in the consumption implied by that consumption..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The Spectacle is not mere supplement or decoration added to the real world, it is the heart of this real society's unreality..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The Spectacle is both the result and the project of the present mode of production..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The Spectacle cannot be understood as mere visual excess from mass media technologies. It is a worldview that has actually been materialized, that has become an objective reality..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The Spectacle is not a collection of images - it is  a social relation between people that is mediated by images..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The only unification The Spectacle can achieve is an official language of separation..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The spectacle presents itself simultaneously as society itself, as part of society, and as a means of unification..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/The specialization of images of the world has culminated in a world of autonomized images where even the deceivers are deceived..md",
    "02-Sources/Books/The Society of Spectacle/Fragmented views of reality regroup themselves into a new unity as a separate pseudo-world that can only be looked at..md",
