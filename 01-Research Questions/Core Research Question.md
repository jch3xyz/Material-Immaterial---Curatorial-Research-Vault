## **Master Research Question**

How does the progressive displacement of embodied human experience by immaterial, data-driven systems reshape the meaning, agency, and relationality of human life — and what new strategies are artists developing to confront, resist, or reimagine this transformation?

## **Sub-Questions**

- In what ways do contemporary artists navigate the boundary between **material presence** and **immaterial simulation**?
    
- How does the **datafication** of bodies, behaviors, and identities alter our experience of self and other?
    
- What is **lost**, **gained**, or **transformed** when physical experience is abstracted into digital or algorithmic forms?
    
- Can **material practices** reclaim space for embodied meaning within an increasingly immaterial world?
    
- How do emerging artistic practices critique, expose, or subvert the **commodification of intimacy, attention, and agency** by technological systems?
    
- What new aesthetic strategies emerge when the **ontology of the human** itself is destabilized by technological mediation?

## **Main Systemic Tension**

| **Pole A**                             | **Pole B**                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Embodied, sensory, material experience | Abstracted, datafied, immaterial simulation   |
| Authentic relational presence          | Synthetic, commodified proxies for connection |
| Human scale and needs                  | Machine optimization and alien imperatives    |

## **Initial Hypotheses**

- **Hypothesis 1:**
    Technological mediation increasingly privileges immaterial abstraction over embodied experience, leading to new forms of alienation, commodification, and perceptual flattening.
    
- **Hypothesis 2:**
    Artists working across material and immaterial mediums are developing strategies that either:
    - expose the hidden infrastructures of technological abstraction,
    - reclaim sensory embodiment,
    - or hybridize material and immaterial elements to destabilize binary categories.
    
- **Hypothesis 3:**
    Experiences designed to confront or heighten awareness of the material/immaterial tension can serve as interventions against passive adaptation to technological systems.

## **Why This Research Matters**

**Historical Context:**
The dematerialization of art was a key concern of conceptual artists in the 1960s and 70s (e.g., Lucy Lippard’s “Six Years: The Dematerialization of the Art Object”). At that time, dematerialization was framed as a **resistance** to commodification.

Today, however, technological dematerialization (through digitization, datafication, and virtualization) often **enables** new forms of commodification and extraction.

The cultural and ontological stakes have shifted — but much of contemporary art theory has not fully caught up to this reversal.

**Contemporary Urgency:**
In an era shaped by ubiquitous surveillance, algorithmic manipulation, synthetic intimacy, and behavioral engineering, questions of materiality and immateriality are no longer formal concerns — they are existential ones.

How we navigate this tension will profoundly shape the future of human experience, perception, and agency.

**Gap in Discourse:**
While many artists gesture toward “technology” as a theme, few projects explicitly surface the deeper ontological stakes of material vs immaterial experience — especially in a way that connects sensory perception, systemic critique, and existential inquiry.

**Cultural Contribution:**
This research aims to articulate and map an emergent field of practices that do not passively aestheticize technological mediation, but instead **challenge**, **reframe**, or **transform** it — offering audiences critical experiences of the shifting ground beneath their own existence.

## **Future Research Directions**

- Close study of lesser-known or hybrid practices that resist clear categorization as either “digital” or “material” art.
    
- Investigation into historical analogues of immateriality and mediation across non-Western traditions.
    
- Development of curatorial methodologies that stage the material/immaterial tension experientially for public audiences (not just discursively).
