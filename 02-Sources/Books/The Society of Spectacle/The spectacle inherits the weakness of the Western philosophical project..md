## Thoughts
It would be interesting to actually be able to isolate and list these weaknesses, but it makes me think that it's not a coincidence that a lot of leftist thinkers end up being interested in eastern philosophy, or having their leftist views in-part shaped by eastern philosophy. Meditation, mindfulness, non-self, impermanence, non-duality - all of these concepts have helped break the spell for me as well.
