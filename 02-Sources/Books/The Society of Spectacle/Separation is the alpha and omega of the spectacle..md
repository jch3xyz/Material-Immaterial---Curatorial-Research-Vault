## Thoughts
This made me think of my sexuality issues again, and contrasting it with my career success. My career overlaps with my hobby. I've always wanted it that way but have always been advised against it. To be fair, it does come with tradeoffs. Now, I consider my career to be going well, my social life to be going well, and my romantic life to be going poorly. One of the differences is that my "romantic life" remains *separate* from the rest, while I allow the rest to heavily overlap. My main issue with the concept of having "jobs" and "hobbies" was that I didn't want the first 8 hours of my day to be completely irrelevant to the second 8 hours of my day. I didn't want a "work-life balance", I just wanted it to by my "life". Romance alone remains separate, and this makes me think that it is no coincidence that it is the part of my life still most ruled by the spectacle. I try to devise ways to *leave my life* to seek romance, because it doesn't feel like something that *belongs* next to everything else. The spectacle has used shame, alienation, and fear to make me believe that it should be a separate domain from the rest of life, else I risk contamination in some sense.

- The spectacle works by **splitting** you:
    - from your own desires
    - from direct experience
    - from your power to act
    - from others

It makes life into **domains**—each with rules, images, scripts.

You’ve been conditioned to believe:
- If I bring my full sexuality into my artistic, professional, or intellectual life, I’ll lose credibility.
- If I make my desire visible, I’ll be objectified or dismissed.
- If I integrate romance into my creative or social world, I’ll mess up the ecosystem I’ve built.

This is how the spectacle enforces shame:
- Not just through repression—but through **spatial and symbolic separation**.
- It makes sex feel like something that must be **secluded**, **coded**, or **ritualized elsewhere**.
