## Thoughts
This is related to my sexual issues born of early porn addiction. Porn is a spectacle of sex. Sex is a natural part of the real world, the real social practice. Yet, inundated with porn, it seems as though the goal of sex is to *look* a certain way during the act. It's about how it *looks*, not how it *feels* or what it's *doing*.  
- The **spectacle of sex** replaces real sexual experience.
- The **function of sex shifts**: from relational/emotional → toward **visual performance**.
- I don’t _feel_ like a lover—I feel like a bad actor in the wrong role.
- The **split** between image and reality **mutilates desire**, leaving shame, confusion, alienation.
