## Thoughts
Is sleep good or bad in this sense? Don't we not want to be dreaming?

 **“The spectacle is the bad dream of a modern society in chains…”**
- Society is **unfree**—trapped in systems it doesn’t control (capitalism, media, alienation).
- The spectacle is its **dream state**:
    Not a hopeful fantasy, but a **disorienting simulation**.
    A dream that **distracts from the chains** rather than breaking them.

 **“…and ultimately expresses nothing more than its wish for sleep.”**
- Deep down, society doesn’t want to wake up.
- It **prefers sedation** to confrontation.
    It’s easier to scroll, to shop, to consume images than to face pain, contradiction, or change.

This is where the spectacle becomes not just illusion, but **self-protective illusion**.

 **“The spectacle is the guardian of that sleep.”**
- It **maintains the trance**, keeps you dreaming instead of acting.
- Every image, ad, performance of life **reinforces sleep**—smooths over the cracks.
- Even [[Therapy-Speak ]]can become a **self-soothing narrative** that avoids real transformation.

So by "guardian of that sleep", he really means the gatekeeper of waking up. It keeps us asleep. Sedated with positivity, never having to face reality.
