## Thoughts
The Spectacle is delivered through media. When we're not working, we consume media - entertainment, advertising, propaganda, news, etc. Social media might be some Frankenstein combination of all of the above. We look to The Spectacle to motivate us to keep working and to work harder. We also allow the spectacle to pacify us with pleasure, keep us from trying to change anything.
