## Thoughts
Is this the expression of anarchism?

- The modern state doesn’t float above these divisions—it **emerges from them**.
- The state is not neutral—it is a **product of the division of labor**, which always includes hierarchy and control.

He's not saying the concept of a state is bad, he's saying that the modern state has emerged from the modern system and thus reinforces it. It's the same stance I have towards technology.

- Unlike orthodox Marxism, which sees the state as something to be **captured and used for revolution**, Debord suggests the state is so **embedded in alienation** that it cannot be reformed or repurposed.
	- **Anarchism** tends to emphasize **voluntary association and horizontalism**
	- **Debord** emphasizes **consciousness, detournement, and revolutionary praxis**—less about governance structures, more about perception and experience
