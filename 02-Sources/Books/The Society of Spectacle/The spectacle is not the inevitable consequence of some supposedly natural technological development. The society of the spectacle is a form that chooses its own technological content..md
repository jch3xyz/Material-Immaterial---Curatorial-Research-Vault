## Thoughts
This is core to my thesis. In other words, the incentives of the system determine its output. Economically successful technologies in the society of the spectacle will necessarily uphold and expand the spectacle. 

This also relates to the premise of something I want to write about rap music. One rap music became absorbed into the system, it stopped having a radical message. Successful rappers are rappers who contribute to the spectacle. This goes for probably most, if not all forms of creative output that make it to significant mainstream success.
