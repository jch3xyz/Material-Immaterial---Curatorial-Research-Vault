## Thoughts
Identity, emotions, desires, self-image, etc. are socially produced, shaped by media, language, and norms.

You can be real, but only as content. We'll watch a video of someone "telling it like it is", but it would be disruptive if they did it around us in real life. We'll watch a video of a crazy person and feel for them, but if they were being crazy around us in real life we would be tacitly scared and hope the problem went away. 

In order to show up in society, you have to be filtered and aestheticized - branded for consumption. Not real.
