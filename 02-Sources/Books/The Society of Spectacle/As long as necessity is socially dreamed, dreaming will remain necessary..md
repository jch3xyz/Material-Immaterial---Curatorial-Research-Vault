## Thoughts
Does he mean that necessity itself is a dream, or that we allow the things that we need to remain dreams?

**“Necessity is socially dreamed”**
= What we **truly need**—freedom, connection, agency, meaning—is not lived directly.
Instead, it’s **represented** and **displaced**:
- Love becomes a dating app fantasy
- Freedom becomes a brand identity
- Community becomes a feed
We **dream** of what we need, rather than **building** it.
The system makes **necessity itself feel distant**, symbolic, mythologized

**“Dreaming will remain necessary”**
= As long as we **don’t meet those needs in reality**, we’ll keep **compensating with dreams**.
That’s the vicious loop of the spectacle:
- Alienated life → need for dreams
- Dreamed needs → continued alienation
