## Notes
### 1. Separation Perfected
- [[In modern societies, everything that was once directly lived has receded into a representation.]] 
- [[Fragmented views of reality regroup themselves into a new unity as a separate pseudo-world that can only be looked at.]] 
- [[The specialization of images of the world has culminated in a world of autonomized images where even the deceivers are deceived.]] 
- [[The spectacle presents itself simultaneously as society itself, as part of society, and as a means of unification.]] 
- [[The Spectacle is the domain of delusion and false consciousness.]]
- [[The only unification The Spectacle can achieve is an official language of separation.]] 
- [[The Spectacle is not a collection of images - it is  a social relation between people that is mediated by images.]] 
- [[The Spectacle cannot be understood as mere visual excess from mass media technologies. It is a worldview that has actually been materialized, that has become an objective reality.]] 
- [[The Spectacle is both the result and the project of the present mode of production.]] 
- [[The Spectacle is not mere supplement or decoration added to the real world, it is the heart of this real society's unreality.]] 
- [[The Spectacle is the model for the prevailing way of life.]]
- [[The Spectacle is the omnipresent affirmation of the choices that have already been made in the sphere of production and in the consumption implied by that consumption.]] 
- [[In both form and content, The Spectacle serves as a total justification of the conditions and goals of the existing system.]]
- [[The Spectacle is also the constant presence of this justification since it monopolizes the majority of the time spent outside the modern production process.]] 
- [[The social practice confronted by an autonomous spectacle is at the same time the real totality which contains that spectacle. But the split within this totality mutilates it to the point that the spectacle seems to be its goal.]] 
- [[The language of the spectacle consists of signs of the dominant system of production - signs which are at the same time the ultimate end-products of that system.]] 
- [[The Spectacle that falsifies reality is nevertheless a real product of that reality, while lived reality is materially invaded by the contemplation of the spectacle and ends up absorbing it and aligning itself with it.]] 
- [[Objective reality is present on both sides. Reality emerges within the spectacle, and the spectacle becomes real. This reciprocal alienation is the essence and support of the existing society.]] 
- [[The spectacle is a visible negation of life - a negation that has taken on a visible form.]] 
- [[The spectacle presents itself as a vast inaccessible reality that can never be questioned. It's sole message is "What appears is good, and what is good appears."]]
- [[The passive acceptance the spectacle demands is already effectively imposed by its monopoly of appearances, its manner of appearing without allowing any reply.]] 
- [[The tautological character of the spectacle stems from the fact that its means and ends are identical.]]
- [[The spectacle is the sun that never sets over the empire of modern passivity. It covers the entire surface of the globe, endlessly basking in its own glory.]]
- [[In the spectacle - the visual reflection of the ruling economic order - goals are nothing, development is everything. The spectacle aims at nothing other than itself.]]
- [[The spectacle is the leading production of present day society.]]
- [[The spectacle is able to subject human beings to itself because the economy has already totally subjugated them. It is at once a faithful reflection of the production of things and a distorting objectification of the producers.]]
- [[The first stage of the economy's domination of social life brought about an evident degradation of being into having - human fulfilment was no longer equated with what one was, but with what one possessed.]] 
- [[The present stage is bringing about a general shift from having to appearing - all having must now derive its immediate prestige and its ultimate purpose from appearances.]]  
- [[All individual reality has become social, in the sense that it is shaped by social forces and is directly dependent on them. Individual reality is allowed to appear only insofar as it is not actually real.]] 
- [[Since the spectacle's job is to use various specialized mediations in order to show us a world that can no longer be directly grasped, it naturally elevates the sense of sight to the special preeminence once occupied by touch.]] 
- [[Vision - the most abstract and easily deceived sense - is most readily adaptable to the generalized abstraction of present-day society.]] 
- [[The Spectacle is whatever escapes people's activity, whatever eludes their practical reconsideration and correction. It is the opposite of dialogue.]]
- [[Wherever representation becomes independent, the spectacle regenerates itself.]]
- [[The spectacle inherits the weakness of the Western philosophical project.]] 
- [[The spectacle does not realize philosophy, it philosophizes reality, reducing everyone's concrete life to a universe of speculation.]]
- [[Philosophy - the power of separate thought and the thought of separate power - was never by itself able to supersede theology.]]
- [[The spectacle is the material reconstruction of the religious illusion.]]
- [[Spectacular technology has not dispersed the religious mists into which human beings had projected their own alienated powers, it has merely brought those mists down to earth.]] 
- [[The illusory paradise representing a total denial of earthly life is no longer projected into the heavens, it is embedded in earthly life itself.]]
- [[The spectacle is the technological version of exiling human powers into a "world beyond" - the culmination of humanity's internal separation.]] 
- [[As long as necessity is socially dreamed, dreaming will remain necessary.]]
- [[The spectacle is the bad dream of a modern society in chains and ultimately expresses nothing more than its wish for sleep. The spectacle is the guardian of that sleep.]] 
- [[The root of the spectacle is that oldest of all social specializations, the specialization of power.]] 
- [[The spectacle plays the specialized role of speaking in the name of all other activities. It is hierarchical society's ambassador to itself, delivering its messages at a court where no one else is allowed to speak.]] 
- [[The spectacle is the ruling order's nonstop discourse about itself, its never-ending monologue of self-praise, its self-portrait at the stage of totalitarian domination of all aspects of life.]]
- [[The fetishistic appearance of pure objectivity in spectacular relations conceals their true character as relations between people and between classes.]] 
- [[The spectacle is not the inevitable consequence of some supposedly natural technological development. The society of the spectacle is a form that chooses its own technological content.]] 
- [[If the administration of this society and all contact between people has become totally dependent on these means of instantaneous communication, it is because this "communication" is essentially unilateral.]] 
- [[The concentration of these media thus amounts to concentrating in the hands of the administrators of the existing system the means that enable them to carry on this particular form of administration.]] 
- [[The social separation reflected in the spectacle is inseparable from the modern state - that product of the social division of labor that is both the chief instrument of class rule and the concentrated expression of all social divisions.]] 
- [[Separation is the alpha and omega of the spectacle.]] 
- [[Religion justified the cosmic and ontological order that corresponded to the interests of the masters, expounding and embellishing everything their societies could not deliver. In this sense, all separate power has been spectacular.]]
- [[The modern spectacle depicts what society could deliver, but in so doing it rigidly separates what is possible from what is permitted.]] 
- [[The spectacle is an autonomously developing power, based on the increasing productivity resulting from an increasingly refined division of labor into parcelized gestures dictated by the independent movement of machines and an ever-expanding market.]] 
- [[In the course of this development, all community and all critical awareness have disintegrated, and the forces that were able to grow by separating from each other have not yet been reunited.]] 
- [[The general separation of worker and product tends to eliminate any direct personal communication between the producers and any comprehensive sense of what they are producing.]]
- [[With the increasing accumulation of separate products and the increasing concentration of the productive process, communication and comprehension are monopolized by the managers of the system.]]
- [[The triumph of this separation-based economic system proletarianizes the whole world.]]
- [[The fundamental experience that in earlier societies was associated with people's primary work is in the process of being replaced by an identification of life with nonworking time, with inactivity.]]
- [[Leisure is in no way liberated from productive activity. It itself is one of the products of the production system.]] 
- [[There can be no freedom apart from activity, and within the spectacle activity is nullified - all real activity having been forcibly channeled into the global construction of the spectacle.]]
- [[Leisure is neither a liberation within work itself nor a liberation from the world shaped by this kind of work. None of the activity stolen through work can be regained by submitting to what that work has produced.]] 
- [[The reigning economic system is a vicious circle of isolation. Its technologies are based on isolation, and they contribute to that same isolation.]] 
- [[The goods that the spectacular system chooses to produce also serve it as weapons for constantly reinforcing the conditions that engender "lonely crowds". With ever-increasing concreteness the spectacle recreates its own presuppositions.]] 
- [[The abstractifying of all individual labor and the general abstractness of what is produced are perfectly reflected in the spectacle, whose manner of being concrete is precisely abstraction.]] 
- [[Spectators are linked solely by their one-way relationship to the very center that keeps them isolated from each other. The spectacle thus reunites the separated, but it reunites them only in their separateness.]] 
- [[The alienation of the spectator works like this - the more he contemplates, the less he lives - the more he identifies with the dominant images of need, the less he understands his own life and desires.]] 
- [[The spectacle's estrangement from the acting subject is expressed by the fact that the individual's gestures are no longer his own - they are the gestures of someone else who represents them to him.]]
- [[The spectator does not feel at home anywhere, because the spectacle is everywhere.]] 
- [[The spectacle's social function is the concrete manufacture of alienation. Economic expansion consists primarily of the expansion of this particular sector of industrial production.]] 
- [[Though alienated from what they produce, people now create every detail of their world with increasing power. Yet the closer their lives come to being their own creation, the more alienated they become from those lives.]] 
- [[The spectacle is capital accumulated to the point that it becomes images.]]
