## Notes
### 1. Separation Perfected
- [[In modern societies, everything that was once directly lived has receded into a representation.]] 
- [[Fragmented views of reality regroup themselves into a new unity as a separate pseudo-world that can only be looked at.]] 
- [[The specialization of images of the world has culminated in a world of autonomized images where even the deceivers are deceived.]] 
- [[The spectacle presents itself simultaneously as society itself, as part of society, and as a means of unification.]] 
- [[The Spectacle is the domain of delusion and false consciousness.]]
- [[The only unification The Spectacle can achieve is an official language of separation.]] 
- [[The Spectacle is not a collection of images - it is  a social relation between people that is mediated by images.]] 
- [[The Spectacle cannot be understood as mere visual excess from mass media technologies. It is a worldview that has actually been materialized, that has become an objective reality.]] 
- [[The Spectacle is both the result and the project of the present mode of production.]] 
- [[The Spectacle is not mere supplement or decoration added to the real world, it is the heart of this real society's unreality.]] 
- [[The Spectacle is the model for the prevailing way of life.]]
- [[The Spectacle is the omnipresent affirmation of the choices that have already been made in the sphere of production and in the consumption implied by that consumption.]] 
- [[In both form and content, The Spectacle serves as a total justification of the conditions and goals of the existing system.]]
- [[The Spectacle is also the constant presence of this justification since it monopolizes the majority of the time spent outside the modern production process.]] 
- [[The social practice confronted by an autonomous spectacle is at the same time the real totality which contains that spectacle. But the split within this totality mutilates it to the point that the spectacle seems to be its goal.]] 
- [[The language of the spectacle consists of signs of the dominant system of production - signs which are at the same time the ultimate end-products of that system.]] 
- [[The Spectacle that falsifies reality is nevertheless a real product of that reality, while lived reality is materially invaded by the contemplation of the spectacle and ends up absorbing it and aligning itself with it.]] 
- [[Objective reality is present on both sides. Reality emerges within the spectacle, and the spectacle becomes real. This reciprocal alienation is the essence and support of the existing society.]] 
- [[The spectacle is a visible negation of life - a negation that has taken on a visible form.]] 
- [[The spectacle presents itself as a vast inaccessible reality that can never be questioned. It's sole message is "What appears is good, and what is good appears."]]
- [[The passive acceptance the spectacle demands is already effectively imposed by its monopoly of appearances, its manner of appearing without allowing any reply.]] 
- [[The tautological character of the spectacle stems from the fact that its means and ends are identical.]]
- [[The spectacle is the sun that never sets over the empire of modern passivity. It covers the entire surface of the globe, endlessly basking in its own glory.]]
- [[In the spectacle - the visual reflection of the ruling economic order - goals are nothing, development is everything. The spectacle aims at nothing other than itself.]]
- [[The spectacle is the leading production of present day society.]]
- [[The spectacle is able to subject human beings to itself because the economy has already totally subjugated them. It is at once a faithful reflection of the production of things and a distorting objectification of the producers.]]
- [[The first stage of the economy's domination of social life brought about an evident degradation of being into having - human fulfilment was no longer equated with what one was, but with what one possessed.]] 
- [[The present stage is bringing about a general shift from having to appearing - all having must now derive its immediate prestige and its ultimate purpose from appearances.]]  
- [[All individual reality has become social, in the sense that it is shaped by social forces and is directly dependent on them. Individual reality is allowed to appear only insofar as it is not actually real.]] 
- [[Since the spectacle's job is to use various specialized mediations in order to show us a world that can no longer be directly grasped, it naturally elevates the sense of sight to the special preeminence once occupied by touch.]] 
- [[Vision - the most abstract and easily deceived sense - is most readily adaptable to the generalized abstraction of present-day society.]]
