## Thoughts
This has also been my experience and observation of sexuality. How things look and how things feel are 2 separate things. In europe I went to a prostitute that was the image of a typical pornstar I would like to watch. It did not *feel* nearly as good as the first prostitute I went to who did not have all of the qualities of the spectacle.

In [[Pulp Fiction]] there's a scene where the girlfriend is telling the boxer that she prefers fat women (referring to pregnant women) because the sensation of touch actually *feels* better, there's more softness, etc. But, she said, men are too preoccupied by how women *look*.
