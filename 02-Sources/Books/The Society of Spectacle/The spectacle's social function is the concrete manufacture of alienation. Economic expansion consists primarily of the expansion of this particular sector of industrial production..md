## Thoughts
Why would economic growth depend on alienation?

**Alienation fuels consumption**
- When you’re disconnected from:
    - Your body → you buy health, beauty, porn
    - Your community → you buy identity, status, connection
    - Your purpose → you buy distraction, productivity hacks, life coaches
- The economy grows by **selling substitutes for wholeness**

**The more disconnection, the more marketable solutions.**
