## Thoughts
I got an idea for an art piece right out of this mental image:
- A selection of physical items, such as plates and vases, arranged on the ground.
- A camera placed above them.
- Camera feed is projected onto the ceiling.
- In between capture and display, the camera feed can be processed to be brighter or more colorful. Or it could go the opposite way and be more obviously digital or degraded.

The participants' attention will naturally be drawn to the projection instead of to the real items in the room.

[[The Attention Economy]] 

What if thereâ€™s a **hidden message or visual only visible in the real world**, rewarding those who break the spell of the image?
