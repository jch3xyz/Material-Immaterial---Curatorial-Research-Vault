## Thoughts
"Fetish" and "Pure Objectivity" seem like jargon keywords, but I think he's just reiterating that the spectacle presents itself as obvious, true, and real instead of a constructed unreality. 

**“Fetishistic appearance”**
- From **Marx’s “commodity fetishism”**:
    When we treat objects as if they have **intrinsic value**, rather than seeing the **human labor and relationships** that created them.
- “Fetish” here = **misplaced perception**:
    You see the product, not the people; the image, not the system.

**“Pure objectivity”**
- The spectacle **pretends to be neutral**:
    Ads, news, lifestyle images all seem like simple facts or personal choices.
- But in reality, they reflect **specific power structures** and **economic interests**.

Yes, **The spectacle pretends to show you objective truth—but it’s actually hiding human and class relationships behind images.**
