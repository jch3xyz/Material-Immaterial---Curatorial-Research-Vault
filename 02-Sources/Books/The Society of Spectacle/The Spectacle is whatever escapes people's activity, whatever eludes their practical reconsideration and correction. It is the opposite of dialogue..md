## Thoughts
So it's basically mindfulness and critical thinking that can disrupt the spectacle's control over a person - break the hypnosis; but, at the same time, there will always be a blind spot where the spectacle remains unexamined. 

What if we make an image that **seems to belong** to the spectacle but contains a **corruption**—a viral contradiction that disrupts the viewer’s trust in what they’re seeing?

This is like:
- A **data poisoning attack** on the cognitive schema the spectacle installs
- A **Trojan horse** that enters via the visual immune system and then **spreads dissonance**

The problem is that the spectacle is resilient. It can **reabsorb critique** and **turn it into content**.
