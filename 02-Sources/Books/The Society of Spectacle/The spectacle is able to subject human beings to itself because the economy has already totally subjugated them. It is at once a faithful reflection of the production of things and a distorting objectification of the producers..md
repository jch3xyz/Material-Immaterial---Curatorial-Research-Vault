## Thoughts
"The economy has subjugated us". Everybody has to work, it is a mandate - a dictate. We don't just have to work, it is mandated that we work in a way that maximizes shareholder value. That's what work means. If you don't do that then you won't have housing, food, clothing, healthcare, education, etc. It's not a choice. But the spectacle gives us something to desire within the system. It presents the "outs" of the system as accessible only through maximally engaging *with* the system.
