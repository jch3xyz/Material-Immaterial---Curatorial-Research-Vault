## Thoughts
What are the fluid aspects of human activity? Have any of them not yet become spectacle? Maybe there were some before social media but now there surely must be none left right?
- **Conversation** – live, unscripted, responsive exchange
- **Walking through a city** – discovering, wandering, encountering
- **Love and desire** – uncommodified, intimate, improvisational
- **Play** – free, purposeless exploration
- **Rebellion** – spontaneous refusal of norms or structures
- **Storytelling** – oral, local, shaped by presence and emotion
- **Shared time** – being present with others in unmediated experience

some fluid experiences still **resist capture** — usually those that are:
- ~~**Deeply embodied** (e.g. eye contact, sex, breathwork)~~
- **Inaccessible to tech** (e.g. dreams, private rituals, genuine care)
- **Anti-spectacular by nature** (e.g. grief, illness, death)
But they’re rare and shrinking.

What's the difference between a living value and an abstract value?

**Living value**:
- Rooted in **direct experience**
- Felt through the **body, senses, emotion**
- Emerges **organically** in relationships and life
- Is **subjective, contextual, temporal**
- Example: “Joy,” “love,” “generosity,” “presence,” “wonder”

**Abstract value**:
- **Detached** from direct experience
- **Quantified**, **codified**, **measured**
- Defined by **systems**, **algorithms**, **exchange**
- Can be assigned to **objects**, **brands**, or **images**
- Example: “Engagement rate,” “brand loyalty,” “aesthetic,” “coolness,” “productivity”

So when the spectacle “inverts” values, it turns something like:
- **Living generosity** → into **a philanthropic brand campaign**
- **Real love** → into **a Valentine’s Day purchase**
- **Presence with a friend** → into **a selfie with a friend**

The **meaning detaches from the moment**, and becomes **a thing, a symbol, a signal**—which can now circulate _without_ the original context.
