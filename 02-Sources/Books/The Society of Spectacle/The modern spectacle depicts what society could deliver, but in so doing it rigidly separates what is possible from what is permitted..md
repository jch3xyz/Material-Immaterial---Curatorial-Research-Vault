## Thoughts
Does this mean whatever is depicted in the spectacle is not permitted to be experienced? It feels related to why I always need permission to do things, especially in the romantic sphere.

 “Whatever is depicted in the spectacle is not permitted to be experienced.”
Not as yourself.
Not organically.
Not without cost.

Instead, it must be:
- Bought
- Performed
- Mediated
- Earned
- **Granted**
