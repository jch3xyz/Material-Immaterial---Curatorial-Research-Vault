## Thoughts
- A _commodity_ is something made not for personal use, but for exchange — like shoes made to sell, not to wear.
- In a commodity-driven society, we start seeing **human relationships, labor, even consciousness** as if they were objects or tools — not living, dynamic things.
- People’s minds get shaped by this process.
- You start to **see yourself and others through the logic of commodities**: what can you produce? What’s your market value? Are you productive?
- We begin to **internalize** the system that turns people into things.
- Instead of **actively shaping** your life or society, you’re forced to **watch it happen** — you’re a **spectator**, not a participant.
- You “do work,” but the work doesn’t feel like _your_ expression — you’re just a cog, observing the system from within it.
