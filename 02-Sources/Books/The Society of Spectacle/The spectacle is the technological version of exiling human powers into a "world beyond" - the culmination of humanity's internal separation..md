## Thoughts
**“Human powers” = our capacity for:**
- Self-awareness
- Direct experience
- Imagination
- Agency
- Dialogue
- Creation of meaning

**In pre-spectacle societies:**
- These powers were already being projected outward—into gods, myths, ideologies.
- We **imagined our essence outside ourselves**, as something **external and unreachable**.

**The spectacle is the technological culmination of that pattern**
- Now our powers are projected not into gods, but into **media, screens, systems of appearance**.
- The “world beyond” is no longer spiritual—it’s **technological and visual**.
- It still holds our meaning, but it’s **outside our reach**, **outside our control**.

This has to do with [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[The Death of God]].
