## Thoughts
I wonder if I could devise an experiential art piece that demonstrates this or breaks it.

Imagine a spectacular object - a glowing orb in the sky that trippy animations on it. It looks cool and draws attention but has no content. 2 people are looking at it. Then, suddenly, on the orb, instead of seeing trippy visuals, each person see's a live camera feed of the other person looking up at the orb. They're forced to content with the presence of the other person in the room. They're forced to contend with the discomfort of now being perceived. And for at least that instant of the switch, they experience a direct realization of the being united in their separateness, attention diverted by the spectacle.
