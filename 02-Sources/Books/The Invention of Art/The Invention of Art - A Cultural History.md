## Notes
#### Preface
- [[Fine Art are things made for aesthetic looking - tokens of art itself.]] 
- [[Discussion of "The Arts" should encompass Music and Literature as well.]]
#### Introduction
- [[One Reason for the expansion in what gets considered art is that the art world has taken up the old theme of unifying "art" and "life".]] 
- [[Postmodernists agree that the expansion of what gets considered art signifies the "death" of modern art, but invite us to dance on its grave in celebration of yet another liberation.]] 
- [[Art as we have generally understood it is a European invention barely 200 years old. It was preceded by a broader, more utilitarian system of art that lasted over 2,000 years, and it is likely to be followed by a third system of the arts.]] 
- [[The assimilation of the activities and artifacts of all peoples and all past epochs into the European Enlightenment notion of "Art" was a byproduct of colonialism.]] 
- [[Isolating works from their original context reinforces the false impression that the people of the past shared our notion of art as a realm of autonomous works meant for aesthetic contemplation.]] 
- [[Only by a deliberate effort can we break the trance induced by our culture and see that the category of fine art is a recent historical construction that could disappear in its turn.]] 
##### The Great Division
- [[The english word "art" is derived from the Latin "ars" and the Greek "techne", which meant any human skill. The opposite of human art in this sense was not craft but nature.]] 
- [[In the 18th century the concept of art was split into the fine arts (poetry, painting, sculpture, architecture, music) and the crafts and popular arts (shoemaking, embroidery, storytelling, popular songs, etc.).]] 
- [[In the 19th century, "art" become synonymous with "fine art". Crafts and popular arts were no longer considered arts at all.]] 
- [[The fracture is not only art from craft, but also of artist from craftsperson and of aesthetic concerns from utility and ordinary pleasures.]] 
- [[The other division that occurred in the split of art from craft was the division of refined pleasure from ordinary pleasure. The refined or contemplative pleasure came to be called by the new name "aesthetic".]] 
- [[By the early 19th century, the function of art was also divided. Fine art was given a transcendent spiritual role of revealing higher truth or healing the soul - a function heretofore applied primarily to God and religion.]] 
- [[Instead of the modern art museum, the 16th and 17th centuries had the "cabinet of curiosities", which displayed seashells, clocks, sculptures, and precious stones as a visual table of knowledge.]]
- [[Most artisan-artists worked on commissions from patrons whose contracts often specified content, form, and materials and envisaged a specific place and purpose for the finished piece.]]
- [[Leonardo da Vinci signed a contract for "Virgin of the Rocks" that specified the contents, color of the Virgin's robe, the date of delivery, and a guarantee of repairs.]] 
- [[Making art was usually a cooperative affair, with many minds and hands involved - painting frescos, multiple authorship theatre productions, free borrowing of melodies and harmonies among composers, etc.]] 
- [[The ideal of the modern system of (fine) art is in individual creation where works exist for themselves and are meant for silent reverential attention in concert halls, art museums, theaters, and reading rooms.]] 
- [[The key factor in splitting apart the old art system was the replacement of patronage by an art market and a middle-class art public.]]
- [[When the genres and activities chosen for elevation and those chosen for demotion reinforce race, class, and gender lines, what once looked like a purely conceptual change begins to look like an underwriting of power relations as well.]]
