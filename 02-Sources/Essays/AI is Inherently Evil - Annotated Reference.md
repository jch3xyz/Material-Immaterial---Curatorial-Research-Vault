## Core Thesis

AI is not neutral or merely flawed—it is structurally aligned with technocapitalism and recursively degrades both the form and reference of information. As AI becomes more efficient, it replaces labor, reference, and meaning with optimized patterns of simulation, ultimately accelerating systemic collapse.

## Theoretical Frameworks

- **Apocalypticism** – AI as a secular version of the rapture/singularity myth
    
- **Accelerationism** – Technocapitalism’s recursive drive toward collapse
    
- **Ellul’s Technique** – The autonomous logic of efficiency overtaking human judgment
    
- **Enshittification (Doctorow)** – Platforms degrading user value over time in service of profit

## Key Concepts

#### **1.** 

#### **Information = Form + Reference**

- _Form_: The container or pattern (e.g. language, symbols)
    
- _Reference_: The material or experiential reality pointed to
    
- AI replicates form but progressively loses connection to reference.
    

  

#### **2.** 

#### **Technocapitalist Attributes of AI**

- **Universal**: Can represent any labor
    
- **Autonomous**: Requires little human input
    
- **Immaterial**: Cheap to replicate, detached from material cost
    
- **Totalizing**: Displaces or erases alternatives
    
- These incentives drive recursive optimization and cultural homogenization.
    

  

#### **3.** 

#### **Model Collapse**

- Recursive training on AI-generated content → meaning decay
    
- Collapse not as dramatic explosion, but entropic loss of reference
    
- System fails when its predictions contradict survival imperatives
    

  

#### **4.** 

#### **Internet as Engine of Collapse**

- Platforms incentivize aggression, incompleteness, personalization, and hierarchy
    
- Structural bias in data > neutral interface is impossible
    
- AI accelerates the decay already embedded in the internet’s design

## Annotated Highlights

- _“AI does not create, but predict information, and it predicts new results based exclusively on old outcomes.”_ → Supports your critique of AI as conservative, not generative.
    
- _“AI is a digitization of labor itself.”_ → Use this in framing AI as post-labor infrastructure, not just a ‘tool.’
    
- _“Platforms serve themselves first, the networks they host second, and individual exceptions last, if at all.”_ → Connect this to your design ethics and opposition to extractive UX.
    
- _“Collapse ends when the data a system generates contradicts decisions necessary to the survival of either the system or its users.”_ → Consider using this as a tagline or anchor in your future talks.

## Connections



## Further Research Directions

- **Compare Ellul’s “technique” with your own experience of TouchDesigner or generative tools**: Are you able to use them without being subsumed by their logic? Where do you resist the path of efficiency?
    
- **Explore the symbolic vs. the recursive**: The essay warns of recursive collapse—so what would _non-recursive_ or _symbolic systems_ look like instead? Could art encode new reference structures?
    
- **Design an artwork that foregrounds the difference between form and reference**: What would it mean to experience reference _without_ form (e.g. bodily presence)? Or form _without_ reference (e.g. AI-generated facsimile)?
    
- **Translate this into a public engagement format**: Could this essay inform an NMN public program? E.g. a symposium, installation, or campaign titled “Totalized Systems” or “Recursive Collapse”?
