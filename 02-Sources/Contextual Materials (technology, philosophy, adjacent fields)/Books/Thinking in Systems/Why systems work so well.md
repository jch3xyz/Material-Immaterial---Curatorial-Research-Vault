1. **Resilience**
	- Resilience is a measure of a system’s ability to survive and persist within a variable environment
	- The opposite of resilience is bitterness or rigidity
	- Resilience arises from a rich structure of many feedback loops that can work in different ways to restore a system even after a large perturbation.
	- A set of feedback loops that can restore it or rebuild feedback loops is *meta-resilience.*
	- There are always limits to resilience
	- Resilience is not the same thing as being static or constant over time. Systems that are constant over time can be unresilient. 
	- Because resilience may not be obvious without a whole-system view, people often sacrifice resilience for stability, or for productivity, or for some other more immediately recognizable system property.
	- <u>Loss of resilience can come as a surprise, because the system is usually losing much more attention to its play than to its playing space.</u>
1. **Self-Organization**
	- Even higher meta-resilience comes from feedback loops that can learn, create, design, and evolve ever more complex restorative structures. Systems that can do this are *self-organizing.*
	- Self-organization is the capacity of a system to make its own structure more complex
	- Since self-organization is such a common property of living systems, we take it for granted. If we didn’t, we would do better at encouraging rather than destroying the self-organizing capacities of the systems of which we are a part.
	- Like resilience, self-organization is often sacrificed for purposes of short-term productivity and stability.
	- Self-organization requires freedom and experimentation, and a certain amount of disorder. These conditions can often be scary to individuals and threatening to power structures.
	- It used to be thought that evolutionary systems were simply not understandable, but just a few simple organizing principles can lead to wildly diverse self-organizing structures.
1. **Hierarchy**
	- Self-organizing systems often generate hierarchy
	- The world seems to be organized into subsystems aggregated into larger subsystems, aggregated into still larger subsystems.
	- The arrangement of systems and subsystems is called a hierarchy
	- If subsystems can largely take care of themselves, regulate themselves, maintain themselves, and yet serve the needs of the larger system, while the larger system coordinates and enhances the functioning of the subsystems, a stable, resilient, and efficient structure results.
	- Complex systems can evolve from simple systems only if there are stable intermediate forms. The resulting complex forms will naturally be hierarchic.
	- Hierarchies reduce the amount of information that any part of the system has to keep track of.
	- In hierarchical systems relationships *within* each subsystem are denser and stronger than relationships *between* subsystems. This minimizes feedback delays.
	- When hierarchies break down, they usually split sing their subsystem boundaries. Much can be learned by taking apart systems at different hierarchical levels and studying them separately.
	- Hierarchies evolve from the lowest level up—from the pieces to the whole.
	- The original purpose of a hierarchy is always to help its originating subsystems do their jobs better.
	- When a subsystem’s goals dominate at the expense of the total system’s goals, the resulting behavior is called *suboptimization*. 
	- To be a highly functional system, hierarchy must balance the welfare, freedoms, and responsibilities of the subsystems and total system—there must be enough central control to achieve coordination toward the large-system goal, and enough autonomy to keep all subsystems flourishing, functioning, and self-organizing.
