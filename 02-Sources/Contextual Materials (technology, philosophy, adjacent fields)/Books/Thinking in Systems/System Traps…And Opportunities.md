**Archetypes** **= system structures that produce common patterns of problematic behavior**
- The destruction they cause is often blamed on particular actors or events, although it is actually a consequence of system structure.
- Blaming, disciplining, firing, twisting policy levers harder—these standard responses will not fix structural problems.

- **Policy Resistance—Fixes that Fail**
	- Balancing loops stabilize systems, but some behavior patterns that persist over a long period of time are undesirable.
	- Policy resistance comes from the bounded rationalities of the actors in a system. Each actor forms a balancing feedback loop with regard to their personal interests. Such resistance to change arises when goals of subsystems are different from and inconsistent with each other.
	- Such resistance to change arises when goals of subsystems are different from and inconsistent with each other.
	- In a policy-resistant system, everyone has to put in great effort into keeping the system where no one wants it to be. Because actors are pulling the system in different directions, if anyone lets up, the others will drag the system closer to their goals, and farther from the goals of the one who let go.
		- Intensification of anyone’s efforts lead to intensification of everyone’s efforts. It would take a lot of mutual trust to reduce intensification. This motion in one-direction is like a ratchet.
	- One way to deal with policy resistance it to try to overpower it. If you wield enough power and can keep wielding it, the power approach can work, at the const of monumental resentment and the possibility of explosive consequences if the power is ever let up.
	- The alternative to overpowering policy resistance is counterintuitive: let go. Give up ineffective policies. Let the resources and energy spent on both enforcing and resisting be used for more constructive purposes. You won’t get your way with the system, but it won’t go as far in a bad direction as you think, because much of the action you were trying to correct was in response to your own action.
		- That calming down may provide the opportunity to look more closely at feedbacks within the system, to understand the bounded rationality behind them, and to find a way to meet the goals of the participants in the system while moving the state of the system in a better direction.
	- The most effective way of dealing with policy resistance is to find a way of aligning the various goals of the subsystems, usually by providing an overarching goal that allows all actors to break out of their bounded rationality.
		- Harmonization of goals is not always possible, but it can only be found by letting go of narrow goals and considering the long-term welfare of the entire system.
- **The Tragedy of the Commons**
	- Tragedy of the commons comes about when there is escalation, or just simple growth, in a commonly shared, erodible environment. 
	- Everyone shares individual benefits from the commons, but shares collective drawbacks. Due to bounded rationality, the pros will always seem to outweigh the cons in any individual decision to use more of the commons. The benefit is +1, but the drawback is a fraction of -1. 
	- In any commons system, there is a resource that is commonly shared. For the system to be subject to tragedy, the resource must be not only limited, but erodible when overused, and the users of the resource must have a good reason to increase, and increase at a rate *that is not influenced by the condition of the commons.*
	- The tragedy of the common arises from lacking a feedback loop between the resource and the growth of the users of that resource. Or perhaps the feedback is too long delayed.
	- The larger the commons is, the more distributed the consequences, the more bounded the rationality, the more prone to tragedy.
	- There are 3 ways to avoid the tragedy of the commons
		1. *Educate and exhort* — Help people to see the consequences of unrestrained use of the commons. Appeal to their morality. Persuade them to be temperate. Threaten transgressors with social disapproval or eternal hellfire.
			- This may attract people who have no respect for the morality.
		1. *Privatize the commons* — Divide it up, so that each person reaps the consequences of their own actions. If some people overexploit their own private resource, then they will harm only themselves and not others.
			- Some commons, such as the atmosphere, simply cannot be privatized.
		1. *Regulate the commons* — Regulation can take many forms, from outright bans on certain behaviors to quotas, permits, taxes, incentives. To be effective, regulation must be enforced by policing and penalties.
			- Regulators must have the expertise to monitor and interpret correctly the condition of the commons, they must have effective means of deterrence, and they must have the good of the whole community at heart. (They cannot be uninformed, weak, or corrupt.)
			- Limit the freedom to abuse a commons, while preserving the freedom to use it.
- **Drift to Low Performance—Boiled Frog Syndrome**
	- “Drift to low performance” archetype systems not only resist policy and stay in a normal bad state, they keep getting worse. 
	- There is a balancing feedback loop in which the perceived state of the system is compared to the desired state. If there is a discrepancy, then a corrective action is taken. The drift to low performance is caused by having a negative bias in perception *and* lowering the desired state based on perceived bad performance. This creates a reinforcing feedback loop of continually lowering performance standards, or “eroding goals”.
	- A frog placed in boiling water will jump out immediately. A frog placed in cold water that heats up to boiling gradually, will stay in the water happily until it is killed. Its balancing feedback loop reacts to the small relative change in temperature instead of to the large absolute change in temperature. The drift to low performance happens gradually so that incremental decreases escape perception.
		- Like gaining weight over time. If you gained 20lbs in a day, that might trigger a corrective action, but if you gain 0.2 lbs everyday indefinitely, none of the incremental changes trigger a corrective action.
	- There are 2 solutions to eroding goals
		1. Keep standards absolute regardless of performance
		1. Make goals sensitive to the *best* performances of the past, instead of to the worst.
			- This could create a reinforcing feedback loop in the opposite direction, gradually *increasing* performance indefinitely
- **Escalation**
	- Escalation comes from a reinforcing feedback loop set up by competing actors trying to get ahead of each other. 
		- The goal of one actor (or one part of the system) is not absolute, but I related to another actor (or part of the system)
		- Each actor takes its desired state from the other’s perceived system state—and ups it
	- “I’ll raise you one” is the decision rule that leads to escalation.
	- Escalation can happen towards a desirable or an undesirable goal.
	- The best way out of escalation is to avoid getting in it, but if caught, there are 2 ways out:
		1. Refuse to compete by unilaterally disarming, thereby interrupting the feedback loop (generally unthinkable given the logic of the system)
		1. Negotiate a new system with balancing feedback loops to control the escalation. (Not easy to accomplish, and compromises usually leave both parties displeased to greater or lesser degree)
- **Success to the Successful—Competitive Exclusion**
	- Success to the successful occurs whenever the winner of a competition receive, as part of the reward, the means to compete even more effectively in the future. That’s a reinforcing feedback loop, which rapidly divides a system into winners who go on winning, and losers who go on losing.
	- If the winning takes place in a limited environment, such that everything the winner wins is extracted from the losers, the losers are gradually bankrupted, or forced out, or starved.
		- “All money adds up to zero, so the rich are exacting money from the middle class and money is accumulating at the top.”
	- Market competition systematically eliminates market competition
	- Species and companies sometimes escape competitive exclusion by *diversifying*, occupying a new niche. However, if successful, this new niche will attract competitors, and the new market will move toward competitive exclusion again. 
		- Diversification doesn’t work as a strategy for the poor—monopolizing firms (or species) have the power to crush all offshoots, or buy them up, or deprive them of the resources they need to stay alive. (Google)
	- The success-to-the-successful loop can be kept under control by putting feedback loops into place that keep any competitor from taking over entirely. 
		- That’s what antitrust laws do in theory and sometimes in practice. However, one of the resources very big companies can win by winning is the power to weaken the administration of antitrust laws.
	- The most obvious way out of the loop is to periodically “level the playing field”.
		- Many traditional societies have some version of the Native American “potlatch”, a ritual in which those who have the most give away many of their possessions to those who have the least. (Tax the rich, not as a punishment, but as a reward—facilitate the long-term health of the system that you benefited from. Nobly support society with your success.)
		- Losers, if they are unable to get out of the loop and have no hope of winning, could get frustrated enough to *destroy* the playing field—they level the playing field themselves.
	- Policy levers to limit success to the successful:
		- Strict limitation on the fraction of the pie any one winner may win
		- Level the playing field
			- Remove some of the advantage of the strongest players
			- Increase the advantage of the weakest players
		- Devise rewards for success that do not bias the next round of competition
- **Shifting the Burden to the Intervenor—Addiction**
	- A stock with in-flows and out-flows is maintained by an actor adjusting a balancing feedback loop, making decisions based on their perception of system states. There is a discrepancy between the desired and actual state of the system. The actor takes an action that changes their *perception* of the actual state of the system, but does not change the actual state of the system itself. The temporary fix wears off, and the problem remains, so the fix is needed again and again. A dependency is developed.
	- The action that changes perception is called an *intervention.* In addiction, the burden of fixing the problem is shifted from the actor to the intervention.
	- Some systems really need an intervenor. Shifting a burden can be done purposefully, and can result in an increased ability to keep the system in a desirable state.
		- (Adderrall and Melatonin)
	- The trap is formed if the intervention undermines the original capacity of the system to maintain itself. If that capability atrophies, then more intervention is needed, and a reinforcing feedback loop takes over.
	- *Addiction is finding a quick and dirty solution to the symptom of a problem, which prevents or distracts one from the harder and longer-term task of solving the real problem.*
	- Addictive policies are so easy to sell, so easy to fall for
		- A lot of marketing is trying to sell you addictive partial solutions, because that’s what would generate the most profit over a long period of time. 
			- Hinge essentially markets itself as “not addictive”. By saying it’s “designed to be deleted”, they’re claiming that it will solve the root problem instead of a symptom, which literally can’t be the case.
	- Breaking an addiction is painful. Withdrawal means finally confront the real (and usually much deteriorated) state of the system and taking the actions that the addiction allowed one to put off—addressing the root problem, instead of just the symptoms. 
	- Sometimes a nonaddictive policy can be put in place before quitting to restore the degraded system with a minimum of turbulence. Sometimes there’s no way out but to go cold turkey and just bear the pain.
	- The problem can be avoided up front by intervening in such a way as to *strengthen the ability of the system to shoulder its own burdens.* The secret is to begin not with a heroic takeover, but with a series of questions:
		- Why are the natural correction mechanisms failing?
		- How can obstacles to their success be removed?
		- How can mechanisms for their success be made more effective?
	- Shifting the burden is simply having an intervention. Dependence is when the intervention only addresses the symptoms but does nothing to solve the underlying problem. Addiction is when the intervention that the system is dependent on simultaneously erodes the self-maintaining capacity of the original system, creating a destructive reinforcing feedback loop of more deterioration requiring more intervention, and so on. All the while the underlying problem is never addressed.
	- The solution is to take the focus off of short-term relief and put it on long-term restructuring.
		- If you are the intervenor, work in such a way as to restore or enhance the system’s own ability to solve its problems, then remove yourself.
		- If you are the one with an unsupportable dependency, build your system’s own capabilities back up before removing the intervention.
- **Rule Beating**
	- Rule beating means evasive action to get around the intent of a system’s rules—abiding by the letter, but not the spirit, of the law.
	- Rule beating becomes a problem only when it leads a system into large distortion, unnatural behaviors that would make no sense at all in the absence of the rules.
	- Rules must be designed with the whole system, including its self-organizing evasive possibilities in mind.
	- The way further into the trap is to try to stamp out the self-organizing response by strengthening the rules or their enforcement—usually giving rise to still greater system distortion.
	- The way out of the trap is to use rule beating as useful feedback, and to revise, improve, rescind, or better explain the rules. 
	- Designing rules better means foreseeing as as possible the effects of the rules on the subsystems, including any rule beating they might engage in, and structuring the rules to turn the self-organizing capabilities of the system in a positive direction.
- **Seeking the Wrong Goal**
	- The goal is the direction-setter of the system, the definer of discrepancies that require action, the indicator of compliance, failure, or success toward which balancing feedback loops work.
	- If the goal is defined badly, if it doesn’t measure what it’s supposed to measure, if it doesn’t reflect the real welfare of the system, then the system can’t possibly produce a desirable result.
	- What is your desired system state, and what metric do you use to track it?
	- In seeking the wrong goal, the system obediently follows the rile and produces its specified result—which is not necessarily what anyone actually wants.
	- The way out of seeking the wrong goal is to specify indicators and goals that reflect the real welfare of the system. Be especially careful not to confuse effort with result or you will end up with a system that is producing effort, not result.
