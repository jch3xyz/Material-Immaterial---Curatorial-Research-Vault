- Are the driving factors likely to unfold this way?
- If they did, would the system react this way?
- What is driving the driving factors?

The first question can’t be abated factually. It’s a guess about the future, and the future is inherently uncertain. Although you may have a strong opinion about it, there’s no way to prove you’re right until the future actually happens.

Model utility depends not in whether it’s driving scenarios are realistic (since no one can know that for sure), but on whether it responds with a realistic pattern of behavior.

The third question requires a hard look at those driving factors to see if they are actually independent, or if they are also embedded in the system.
