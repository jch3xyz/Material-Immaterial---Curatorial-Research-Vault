Systems analysis does not contain the key to prediction and control. There is no key to prediction and control. The real world cannot be so neatly discretized.

It’s one thing to understand how to fix a system, and quite another to actually wade in and fix it.

Social systems are the external manifestations of cultural thinking patterns and of profound human needs, emotions, strengths, and weaknesses. Changing the is not as simple as saying “now all change” or of trusting that he who knows the good shall do the good.

Self-organizing, nonlinear, feedback systems are inherently unpredictable. They are not controllable. They are understandable only in the most general way. The goal of foreseeing the future and preparing for it perfectly is unrealizable. 

We can’t control systems or figure them out. But we can dance with them!
- Stay wide awake, pay close attention, participate fully, and respond to feedback.

Living successfully in a world of systems requires more of us than our ability to calculate. It requires our full humanity—our rationality, our ability to sort out truth from falsehood, our intuition, our compassion, our vision, and our morality.

- **Get the beat on the system**
	- Before you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves.
		- If it’s a piece of music or a whitewater rapid or a fluctuation in a commodity price, study its beat.
		- If it’s a social system, watch it work. Learn its history.
	- Starting with the behavior of systems forces you to focus on facts, not theories.
	- Starting with the behavior of systems directs one’s thoughts to dynamic, not static, analysis. Analysis of change, not event.
- **Expose your mental models to the light of day**
	- The more of that you do, in any form, the clearer your thinking will become, the faster you will admit your uncertainties and correct your mistakes, and the more flexible you will learn to be. 
	- Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Collectively critique each other’s models. 
	- Instead of becoming a champion for one possible explanation or hypothesis or model, collect as many as possible. Consider all of them plausible until you find some evidence that causes you to rule one out.
- **Honor, respect, and distribute information**
	- Information holds systems together. Delayed, biased, scattered, or missing information can make feedback loops malfunction. 
	- *Thou shalt not distort, delay, or withhold information*
	- You can make a system work better with surprising ease if you can give it more timely, more accurate, more complete information.
	- Information is power. Anyone interested in power grasps that idea very quickly. They filter and channel information, often for short-term, self-interested purposes.
- **Use language with care and enrich it with systems concepts**
	- Our information streams are composed primarily of language. Our mental models are mostly verbal.
	- Honoring information means about all avoiding language pollution—making the cleanest possible use we can of language. It also means expanding our language so we can talk about complexity.
	- We don’t talk about what we see; *we see only what we can talk about*. 
		- Our perspectives on the world depend on the interaction of our nervous system and our language—both act as filters through which we perceive our world.
	- The language and information systems of an organization fundamentally structure the perceptions and actions of its members. To reshape the measurement and communication systems of a society is to reshape all potential interactions at the most fundamental level.
	- The first step in respecting language is keeping it as concrete, meaningful, and truthful as possible. The second step is to enlarge language to make it consistent with our enlarged understanding of systems. 
- **Pay attention to what is important, not just to what is quantifiable**
	- If quantity forms the goals of our feedback loops, if quantity is the center our attention and language and institutions, if we motivate ourselves, rate ourselves, and reward ourselves on our ability to produce quantity, then quantity will be the result.
	- Pretending that something doesn’t exist if it’s hard to quantify leads to faulty models.
	- If we don’t speak about quality and point towards its presence or absence, it will cease to exist.
- **Make feedback policies for feedback systems**
	- A dynamic, self-adjusting feedback system cannot be governed by a static, unbending policy.
	- Design policies that change depending on the state of the system.
	- Especially when there are great uncertainties, the best policies not only contain feedback loops, but meta feedback loops—loops that alter, correct, and expand loops. These are policies that design *learning* into the management process.
- **Go for the good of the whole**
	- Hierarchies exist to serve the bottom layers, not the top.
	- Don’t maximize parts of systems or subsystems while ignoring the whole.
	- Aim to enhance total systems properties, such as growth, stability, diversity, resilience, and sustainability—whether they are easily measured or not.
- **Listen to the wisdom of the system**
	- Aid and encourage the forces and structures that help the system run itself.
		- Notice how many of those forces and structures are at the bottom of the hierarchy.
	- Don’t be an unthinking intervenor and destroy the system’s own self-maintenance capacities. 
- **Locate responsibility in the system**
	- That’s a guideline for both analysis and design.
		- In analysis it means looking for the ways the system creates its own behavior.
		- In design it means making sure the feedback about the consequences of design making is sent directly, quickly, and compellingly to decision makers. (“Intrinsic Responsibility”)
			- The pilot of a plane is also on the plane, and at the front for that matter.
	- Give individual decision makers *more* responsibility instead of less. (Ex. Privatizing the commons)
- **Stay humble—stay a learner**
	- Trust intuition more, trust figuring-out rationality less, lean on both as much as you can, and still be prepared for surprises. 
	- Mental models are incomplete and the world is complex
	- In a world of complex systems, it is not appropriate to charge forward with rigid, undeviating directives. “Stay the course” is only a good idea if you’re sure you’re on course.
	- Pretending you’re in control even when you aren’t is a recipe not only for mistakes, but for not learning from mistakes.
	- What’s appropriate when you’re learning is small steps, constant monitoring, and a willingness to change course as you find out more about where it’s leading.
	- Both error-embracing and living with high levels of uncertainty emphasize our personal as well as societal vulnerability. Typically we hide our vulnerabilities from ourselves as well as from others. But, to be the kind of person who truly accepts his responsibility requires knowledge of and access to self far beyond that possessed by most people in this society.
- **Celebrate complexity**
	- Don’t try to impose universal order on a universe that produces both order *and* chaos
- **Expand time horizons**
	- The longer the operant time horizon, the better the chances for survival.
	- A society which loses its identity with posterity and which loses its positive image of the future also loses its capacity to deal with present problems, and soon falls apart.
	- In a strict systems sense, there is no long-term, short-term distinction. Phenomena at different time scales are nested within each other. We experience now the consequences of actions set in motion yesterday and decades ago and centuries ago.
	- Watch both the short and the long-term. The whole-system.
- **Defy the disciplines**
	- In spite of what you majored in, or what the textbooks say, or what you think you’re an expert at, follow a system wherever it leads. It will be sure to lead across traditional disciplinary lines.
	- Interdisciplinary communication works only if there’s a real problem to be solved, and if the representatives from the various disciplines are more committed to solving the problem than to being correct. They will have to go into learning mode.
- **Expand the boundary of caring**
	- The real system is interconnected. Every part affects every other part, which means everything is worth caring about if you want the system to succeed. 
- **Don’t erode the goal of goodness**
	- In a classic example of “drift to low performance”, modern industrial culture has eroded the goal of morality. 
	- Don’t weigh the bad news more heavily than the good. And keep standards absolute.
