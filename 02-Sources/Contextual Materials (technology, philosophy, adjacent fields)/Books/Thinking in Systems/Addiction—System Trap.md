A stock with in-flows and out-flows is maintained by an actor adjusting a balancing feedback loop, making decisions based on their perception of system states. There is a discrepancy between the desired and actual state of the system. The actor takes an action that changes their *perception* of the actual state of the system, but does not change the actual state of the system itself. The temporary fix wears off, and the problem remains, so the fix is needed again and again. A dependency is developed.

The action that changes perception is called an *intervention.* In addiction, the burden of fixing the problem is shifted from the actor to the intervention.

Some systems really need an intervenor. Shifting a burden can be done purposefully, and can result in an increased ability to keep the system in a desirable state.

The trap is formed if the intervention undermines the original capacity of the system to maintain itself. If that capability atrophies, then more intervention is needed, and a reinforcing feedback loop takes over.

*Addiction is finding a quick and dirty solution to the symptom of a problem, which prevents or distracts one from the harder and longer-term task of solving the real problem.*

Breaking an addiction is painful. Withdrawal means finally confront the real (and usually much deteriorated) state of the system and taking the actions that the addiction allowed one to put off—addressing the root problem, instead of just the symptoms. 

Sometimes a nonaddictive policy can be put in place before quitting to restore the degraded system with a minimum of turbulence. Sometimes there’s no way out but to go cold turkey and just bear the pain.
