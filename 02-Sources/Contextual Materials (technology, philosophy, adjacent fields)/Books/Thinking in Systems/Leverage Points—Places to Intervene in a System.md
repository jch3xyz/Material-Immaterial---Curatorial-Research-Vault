Leverage Point = places in the system where a small change could lead to a large shift in behavior.
- Often, people embedded in a system can identify problems and intuit correct leverage points, but they often accidentally push change in the wrong direction
- Complex systems are *counterintuitive*
- The higher the leverage point, the more the system will resist changing it.

- **Transcending Paradigms**
		- To keep oneself unattached in the arena of paradigms, to stay flexible, to realize that no paradigm is “true”, that every one, including the one that sweetly shapes your own worldview, is a tremendously limited understanding immense and amazing universe that is far beyond.
		- To “get” on a gut level the paradigm that there are paradigms, and to that that itself is a paradigm, and to regard that whole realization as devastatingly funny. It is to let go into not-knowing, into what the Buddhists call enlightenment.
		- If no paradigm is right, you can choose whatever one will help to achieve your purpose. If have no idea where to get a purpose, you can listen to the universe.
- **Paradigms—The mind-set out of which the system—its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters—arises**
	- “It doesn’t matter how the tax law of a country is written. There is a shared idea in the minds of the society about what a ‘fair’ distribution of the tax load is.”
	- The shared idea in the minds of society constitute that society’s paradigm, or deepest set of beliefs about how the word works.
		- These beliefs are unstated because there’s no need to state them—everyone already knows them.
		- This is the water that the fish doesn’t know is water.
	- Paradigms are the sources of systems.
		- From shared social agreements about the nature of reality come system goals and information flows, feedbacks, stocks, flows, and everything else about system.
	- People who have managed to intervene in systems at the level of paradigm have hit a leverage point that totally transforms systems.
	- A single individual can have their paradigm shifted in a millisecond. All it takes is a click in the mind to precipitate a new way of seeing. Whole societies, however, resist challenges to their paradigms harder than they resist anything else.
	- How do you change paradigms?
		- You keep pointing at the anomalies and failures in the old paradigm.
		- You keep speaking and acting, loudly and with assurance, from the new one.
		- You insert people with the new paradigm in places of public visibility and power.
		- You don’t waste time with reactionaries; rather, you work with active change agents and with the vast middle ground of people who are open-minded.
	- Also, we change paradigms by building a model of the system, which takes us outside the system and forces us to see it whole.
- **Goals—The purpose or function of the system**
	- Every leverage point underneath the goal of a system will be twisted to conform to that goal, even self-organizing behavior. The goal determines the selection mechanism and direction of evolution.
	- Even people within systems often don’t recognize what whole-system goal they are serving.
		- What is the whole-system goal of a corporation? To grow, increase market share, to bring the world (customers, suppliers regulators) more and more under the control of the corporation, so that its operations become more and more shielded from uncertainty.
			- The goal of keeping the market competitive has to trump the goal of each individual corporation to eliminate its competitors, just as in ecosystem, the goal of keeping populations in balance and evolving has to trump the goal of each population to reproduce without limit.
	- Changing the players in a system is a low-level intervention, unless those players are at the top where a single player can have the power to change the system’s goal.
	- There is high leverage in articulating, meaning, repeating, standing up for, and insisting upon new system goals.
- **Self-Organization—The power to add, change, or evolve system structure**
	- Self-organization means changing any aspect of a system lower on this list.
	- The ability to self-organize is the strongest form of system resilience.
	- A system that can evolve can survive almost any change by changing itself.
	- Self-organization is basically a matter of having a highly variable stock of information from which to select possible patterns, and a means for selecting and testing new patterns.
		- Stock of information
		- Source of variety
		- Selection mechanism
	- Insistence on a single culture shuts down learning and cuts back resilience.
	- The leverage point here is obvious, but unpopular: *Encouraging variability and experimentation and diversity means “losing control”*
		- Let 1000 flowers bloom and *anything* can happen instead of what we want to happen.
- **Rules—Incentives, punishments, and constraints**
	- The rules of a system define its scope, its boundaries, its degrees of freedom.
	- Physical laws, laws, punishments, incentives, and informal social agreements are progressively weaker types of rules.
	- As we try to imagine restructured rules and what our behavior would be under them, we come to understand the power of rules.
		- They are high leverage points.
	- Power over rules is real power.
	- If you want to understand the deepest malfunctions of systems, pay attention to the rules and to who has power over them.
- **Information Flows—The structure of who does and does not have access to information**
	- Missing information flows is one of the most common causes of system malfunction.
	- Adding or restoring information can be a powerful intervention.
		- Usually cheaper and easier than rebuilding physical infrastructure
		- It’s important that the missing feedback be restored to the *right place* and in *compelling form*
	- The tragedy of the commons occurs because there is little feedback between the state of the commons and the decision to use it more
	- There’s a systematic tendency for human beings to avoid accountability for their own decisions. That’s why there are so many missing feedback loops. 
		- This type of intervention is usually popular with the masses, and unpopular with the powers that be.
- **Reinforcing Feedback Loops—The strength of the gain of driving loops**
	- Reinforcing feedback loops are sources of growth, explosion, erosion, and collapse in systems. 
	- A system with an unchecked reinforcing feedback loop will ultimately destroy itself.
	- Reducing the gain around a reinforcing feedback loop—slowing the growth—is usually a more powerful leverage point in systems than strengthening balancing loops.
	- Slowing growth gives balancing loops with limits and delays time to function.
		- It’s the same as slowing the car when you’re driving too fast, rather than calling for more responsive brakes or technical advances in steering.
- **Balancing Feedback Loops—The strength of the feedbacks relative to the impacts they are trying to correct**
	- More leverage can be found in the information and control parts of a system than in the physical parts
	- A complex system usually has numerous balancing feedback loops that it can bring into play, so it can self-correct under different circumstances. Some of those loops may be inactive much of the time, but their presence is critical to the long-term welfare of the system.
		- One of the big mistakes we make is to strip away these “emergency” response mechanisms because they aren’t often used and they appear to be costly.
		- The strength of a balancing loop—its ability to keep its appointed stock at or near its goal—depends on the combination of all its parameters and links—the accuracy and rapidity of monitoring, the quickness and power of response, the directness and size of corrective flows. 
			- Sometimes there are leverage points there.
		- The strength of a balancing feedback loop is important *relative to the impact it’s designed to correct*. If the impact increases in strength, the feedbacks have to be strengthened too.
			- The power of big industry calls for the power of big government to hold it in check; a global economy makes global regulations necessary.
- **Delays—The lengths of time relative to the rates of system changes**
	- A system just can’t respond to short-term changes when it has long-term delays
		- That’s why massive central-planning systems necessarily function poorly
	- A delay in a feedback process is critical *relative to the rates of change in the stocks that the feedback loop is trying to control*.
	- Delays that are too short cause overreaction, oscillations amplified by the jumpiness of the response.
	- Delays that are too long cause damped, sustained, or exploding oscillations.
	- Overlong delays in a system with a threshold, a danger point, a range past which irreversible damage can occur, cause overshoot and collapse.
	- Delay length would be a high leverage point, except delays are not often easily changeable. Things take as long as they take.
		- It’s usually easier to *slow down the change rate*, so that the inevitable feedback delays won’t cause so much trouble. That’s why growth rates are higher up on the leverage-point list than delay times.
	- If there is a delay in the system that can be changed, changing it can have big effects, but be careful not to affect change in the wrong direction.
- **Stock-and-Flow Structures—Physical systems and their nodes of intersection**
	- The only way to fix a system that is laid out poorly is to rebuild it
		- When the Hungarian road system was laid out so all traffic from one side of the nation to the other had to pass through central Budapest, that determined a lot about air pollution and commuting delays that not easily fixed by pollution control devices, traffic lights, or speed limits.
	- Physical rebuilding is often the slowest and most expensive kind of change to make in a system.
	- Also, some stock-and-flow structures are just plain unchangeable.
	- Physical structure is crucial in a system, but is rarely a leverage point because changing it is rarely quick or simple. Better to build it right in the first place.
	- After the structure is built, understand its limitations and bottlenecks, and refrain from fluctuations or expansions that strain its capacity.
- **Buffers—The sizes of stabilizing stocks relative to their flows**
	- Stocks that are big, relative to their flows, are more stable than small ones.
	- You can often stabilize a system by increasing the capacity of a buffer.
	- But if a buffer is too big, the system gets inflexible, it reacts too slowly.
	- Some big buffers cost a lot to build or maintain. Sometimes vulnerability to occasional fluctuations is cheaper than the cost of maintaining the buffer, and can make balancing feedback loops more responsive to shifting flows.
	- Many buffers are physical entities that are either constant or otherwise not easy to change. But when they do exist, they can be high leverage.
- **Numbers—Constants and parameters such as subsidies, taxes, standards**
	- The size of the flows is a matter of numbers and how quickly those numbers can be changed
	- Some parameters are physically locked in and unchangeable, but many are not and so are popular points of intervention
	- Numbers/Parameters are the least powerful intervention even though 99% of our attention goes to them. They are intuitive to find as leverage points. It is not intuitive to predict the results of turning a few knobs if they also affect the position of every other knob.
	- *Parameters become leverage points when they go into ranges that kick off one of the items higher on this list.*
	- Usually numbers have a large grey area where they are neither good nor bad, and not worth changing.
