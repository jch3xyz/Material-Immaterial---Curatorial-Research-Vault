A stock is the foundation of any system. Stocks are the elements of the system that you can see, feel, count, or measure at any given time. 

A system stock is a store, a quantity, an accumulation of material or information that has built up over time.

Stocks change over time through the actions of a flow.

Flows are filling and draining, births and deaths, purchases and sales, growth and decay, deposits and withdrawals, successes and failures.

A stock is the memory of the history of changing flows within a system.

If you understand the dynamics of stocks and flows—their behavior over time—you understand a good deal about the behavior of complex systems.
