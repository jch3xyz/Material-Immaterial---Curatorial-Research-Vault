This is a version of the bathtub system, but in the real world flows may have built in delays, especially if they require decision making instead of being governed by laws of physics. 

Inflow and outflow carry a degree of uncertainty. Adjustment of the stock happens imperfectly and not instantaneously. The stock fluctuates in oscillations.

Changing the delays in a system can make it much easier or much harder to manage.
