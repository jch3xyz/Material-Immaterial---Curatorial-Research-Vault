A stock takes time to change, because flows take time to flow.

The time lags imposed by stocks allow room to maneuver, to experiment, and to revise policies that aren’t working.

If you have a sense of the rates of change if stocks, you don’t expect things to happen faster then they can happen. You don’t give up too soon.
