Breaking an addiction is painful. Withdrawal means finally confront the real (and usually much deteriorated) state of the system and taking the actions that the addiction allowed one to put off—addressing the root problem, instead of just the symptoms. 

Sometimes a nonaddictive policy can be put in place before quitting to restore the degraded system with a minimum of turbulence. Sometimes there’s no way out but to go cold turkey and just bear the pain.
