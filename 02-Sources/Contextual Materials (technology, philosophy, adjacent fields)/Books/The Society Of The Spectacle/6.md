In all of its particular manifestations—news, propaganda, advertising, entertainment—the spectacle is the model of the prevailing way of life. 

It is the omnipresent affirmation of the choices that have already been made in the sphere of production and in the consumption implied by that production.

In both form and content as a total justification of the conditions and goals of the existing system.

The spectacle is also the constant presence of this justification since it monopolizes the majority of the time spent outside the modern production process.
