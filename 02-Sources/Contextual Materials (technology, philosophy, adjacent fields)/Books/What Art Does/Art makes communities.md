Art can be a way that people who might be wildly different in many aspects can share something. At the level of feelings we can be equals. We all have them.

Especially in the consumer era, weâ€™ve been encouraged to think of ourselves as separate and independent individuals, whereas our strength as a species comes from our ability to continually adjust and cooperate. Art is one of the most powerful ways of doing that, of finding out where our common grounds and our differences lie.
