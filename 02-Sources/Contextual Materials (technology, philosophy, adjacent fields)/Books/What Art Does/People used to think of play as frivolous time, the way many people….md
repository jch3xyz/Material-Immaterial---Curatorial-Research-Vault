The play of children spans a spectrum. At the one end you could say they are finding out about how the materials of the real world work—how water works, how their bodies work, how strong or flexible or sharp things are. At the other end of the spectrum there is “Let’s pretend”—the invention of games or scenarios, of other worlds that don’t really exist.

Children move fluidly between these two states of mind and often combine them. In the varieties of children’s play we see the origins of not only art and science but many other adult behaviors, like caring and nurturing and philosophizing and deceiving.
