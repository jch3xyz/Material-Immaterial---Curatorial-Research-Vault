## Thoughts
I think this is why people are responding so positively to my art gatherings, and to interactive art in general. The art is not meant for silent reverential attention, it's meant to be played with (together). And it's not separated from life in the hallowed halls of a museum - it's in a garage, a house-party, a backyard, a garden, a workshop. It's not separated and elevated, it's integrated and accessible.

This is connected to my ideal about connecting design and engineering - white collar and blue collar work.
