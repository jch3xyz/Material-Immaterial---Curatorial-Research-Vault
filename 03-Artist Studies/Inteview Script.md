### **0. INTRODUCTION (Before recording)**

- Thank the artist for their time.
    
- Explain briefly:

> _“This conversation is part of a curatorial research project exploring how contemporary artists navigate the tension between material presence and immaterial experience in their work. The research will culminate in public-facing outputs such as an exhibition, a knowledge base, and potentially publications. There’s no obligation to have a ‘finished’ answer — this is about open exploration.”_

- Confirm recording permission (if applicable).

### **1. ORIGIN & CONTEXT**

**1.1** How did you first come to work with new media as a creative material?

(_Follow-up:_ Was it a deliberate choice, or did it emerge through experimentation?)

**1.2** How would you describe the role of materiality — or its absence — in your practice?

(_e.g., tactile materials, digital matter, ephemeral forms, invisible systems_)

---

### **2. RELATIONSHIP TO MATERIAL & IMMATERIAL**

**2.1** In your work, when does materiality feel necessary?

(_What can only be expressed through physical means?_)

**2.2** When do you intentionally move toward immateriality — virtuality, code, light, sound, data?

(_And why?_)

**2.3** Do you see material and immaterial elements as oppositional, complementary, or something else entirely?

---

### **3. TECHNIQUES & STRATEGIES**

**3.1** Could you walk me through a recent project where you navigated the balance between material and immaterial elements?

(_Follow-up prompts:_ What decisions shaped the medium? How did you want viewers to experience presence/absence?)

**3.2** Are there particular materials — or anti-materials (e.g., light, air, signal) — that you return to often? Why?

**3.3** How does audience interaction, embodiment, or perception factor into your work?

(_Is the “material” sometimes the audience’s own behavior or attention?_)

---

### **4. CULTURAL & SYSTEMIC CONTEXT**

**4.1** In an era where digital culture often feels disembodied or dematerialized, how do you think your work engages with that cultural condition?

**4.2** Are there particular technological, social, or philosophical forces you feel you’re responding to — or resisting — through your use of material/immaterial forms?

---

### **5. HISTORICAL & INFLUENTIAL REFERENCES**

**5.1** Are there historical artists, movements, or theories that have influenced your understanding of materiality or immateriality?

(_Conceptual art, minimalism, digital art pioneers, phenomenology, etc._)

**5.2** Are there underappreciated figures or practices you think deserve more attention in this conversation?

---

### **6. OPEN REFLECTION**

**6.1** Is there anything about your relationship to material or immaterial processes that you feel is misunderstood — by audiences, institutions, or even other artists?

**6.2** What questions are you personally exploring right now that feel most alive in your practice?

---

### **7. CLOSING**

- Thank them again.
    
- Ask:
    

> _“Would you be open to being referenced or quoted (with your approval) as part of the public outcomes of this research?”_

> (Or note if this is just background unless otherwise agreed.)

- Optionally invite them to stay in the loop for the project’s evolution.
